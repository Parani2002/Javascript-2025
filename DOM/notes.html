In the DOM all the HTML elements are defined as objects.
Each object has properties and methods.
properties are the values that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).
    * document.getElementById('name').innerHTML = "Paranitharan";
    * getElementById is a method that returns the object with the id 'name'.
    * innerHTML is a property that can be set to change the content of the object.
methods are the actions you can do on the object (like changing the style of an HTML element).
